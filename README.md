# updating from machine

## OSX/MacOS:

Set up hard links/symlinks, bby. They're nice.

- `ln original symlinkTarget`

(creates a hard link. It's like the file's in two places!)

Should allow to roll back/undo changes to the "original" file when updating the local copy of the repo via git pull, if the files have been edited elsewhere.

## Spacemacs

- `.spacemacs`: config file, stored in user's home directory. (`~` or whatever that is on Windows.)

## Vim

- Just the `.vimrc` file.
- gotta install vundle separately and run the `:PluginInstall` command

## zsh

this is nice. It's more convenient than bash. Config doesn't do much. Needs oh-my-zsh.
